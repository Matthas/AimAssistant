My App for thesis that is supposed to simulate Balistic calculator (it doesnt).

If you somehow ended up here looking for some solution, good luck. Its my first app, its ugly, it works but it is still ugly.
If you want to use some code feel free to do so, just dont remind me of this monstrosity.


What you might find here:

Code to transfer Dec numbers to binary numbers and then to IR impulses in RC-5 standard (frequency of 889ms).
Getting pitch from accelerometer.

Lots of monsters.

Yes it is one big wall of text(code) in one file. Yes I did want to make it clean. No I didnt because it just my thesis and no one will look at it.
